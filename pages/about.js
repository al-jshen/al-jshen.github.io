        I am currently doing research in the field of astrostatistics under the
        supervision of{" "}
        <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html">Gwen Eadie</a>
        <a href="https://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~eadie/intro.html">
          &nbsp;
        </a>and <a href="https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~murray/">Norm Murray</a>.
        <a href="https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~murray/">&nbsp;</a>My focus is on
        applying Bayesian statistics to study the mass distribution of the Milky
        Way using kinematic data from tracer objects.

        Before this, I was a summer research student supervised by{" "}
        <a href="https://phas.ubc.ca/users/allison-man">Allison Man</a>. I
        studied molecular gas in faint high redshift galaxies by leveraging
        gravitational lensing.

        new things. Most recently, I've taken up running and playing the guitar.
